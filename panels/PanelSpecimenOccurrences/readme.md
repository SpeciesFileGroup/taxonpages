# PanelSpecimenOccurrences (`panel:specimen-occurrences`)

Replaces the separate `PanelSpecimenRecords` + `PanelFieldOccurrences`. Shows the
CollectionObject / FieldOccurrence records for an OTU (or, above species rank, a
per-species aggregate view).

- `PanelSpecimenOccurrences.vue` — rank switch: species/subspecies →
  `SingleSpeciesOccurrences`, anything higher → `SpeciesBars`.
- `SingleSpeciesOccurrences.vue` — one OTU. Single `dwc.json` fetch, records
  grouped/collapsed by shared collecting event via `lib/groupRecords.js`.
  Country / collector / type / media filters, List vs Phenology view.
- `SpeciesBars.vue` — per-species bars for a higher taxon; expanding one mounts
  `SingleSpeciesOccurrences` for that species.
- `ListRecords.vue`, `MultiSelect.vue` — presentational.

## Shared dependencies

- `../../_shared/DwcTable.vue` — the CO/FO detail modal, opened from the ⓘ button
  on a record row (`SingleSpeciesOccurrences.vue`).
- `../../_shared/ImageLightbox.vue` — the project-wide fullscreen image viewer,
  opened from a record's media thumbnails. Specimen `associatedMedia` images carry
  CO/FO depiction types, so the lightbox also shows the type-status line and its
  own ⓘ back into `DwcTable`.
- `../../_shared/specimenRef.js` — resolves a biological-association participant to
  the physical CO/FO it refers to (used to show the primary association inline on
  each row).
